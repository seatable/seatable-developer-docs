## How to participate

Please fell free to particiate in the developer manual by creating pull requests. Before you do this, please test your changes in a local copy of this manual. Here is how you can do this.

> :warning: Docker is required
>
> We use Docker to create this local manual copy. You have to install docker first, if you don't have it already on your local machine. Use this one line command to easily install it on a linux machine:
>
> `curl -fsSL get.docker.com | bash`

### Step 1: Clone this repository and checkout a new branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seatable/seatable-developer-docs
cd seatable-developer-docs
git checkout -b <new_branch>
# please replace <new_branch> with something short like "add_python_example"
```

### Step 2: Generate your local version of the developer manual

We developed a tiny bash script to generate the local copy of the manual.

```bash
sudo ./preview.sh
```

Initiate your browser and access http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view a local copy of the manual. Any modifications made locally will be instantly reflected in this version. You don't even have to restart docker or reload the page.

The manual can be found within the `docs` folder. For comprehensive guidance on utilizing [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) or [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), refer to their respective manuals for detailed instructions.

### Step 3: Create a pull request

The last step is to create a pull request will your proposed changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<commit_message>"
git push
```

### Step 4: Stop the docker container with your local admin manual copy

```bash
./preview.sh -stop
```
