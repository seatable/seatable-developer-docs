# Generate Barcode

This Python script demonstrates the process of converting text slices into barcode images and storing them in an image column within SeaTable.

## Functionality

- Setup and Authentication: Utilizes SeaTable API credentials for authentication.
- Barcode Generation: Processes rows in a specified SeaTable table, extracting text from a designated column (TEXT_COL) to generate barcode images.
- Association with Records: Associates generated barcode images with the respective records by updating an image column (BARCODE_IMAGE_COL) in the SeaTable table.
- Handling Existing Images: Skips rows if a barcode image already exists for efficient processing.
- Customization Options: Provides customizable parameters such as module width, height, padding, font size, and text-barcode distance for barcode image generation.
- Error Handling: Includes exception handling to manage errors encountered during the barcode image generation process.

## Process Overview

1. Iterates through rows in a specified SeaTable table.
1. Converts text data from a designated column into barcode images using the specified barcode type (BARCODE_TYPE).
1. Saves the generated barcode images temporarily.
1. Uploads the generated barcode images to SeaTable and associates them with corresponding records.
1. Removes temporary barcode image files after successful upload.
1. This script offers an automated way to generate barcode images from text data in a SeaTable table, enhancing data visualization and association within the SeaTable platform.
