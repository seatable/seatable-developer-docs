# Requirements

You've decided to venture into developing your own script, plugin, or custom applicationâ€”excellent choice! This guide is designed to cover all aspects of this journey. While some descriptions might seem obvious to seasoned professionals, this manual is crafted to assist novice developers who are just starting out.

## Development system

To begin your development journey with SeaTable, you'll need a SeaTable system. If you're planning to create short scripts, [SeaTable Cloud](https://seatable.com/prices/) could be a suitable option. However, for more in-depth development or when creating plugins, it's highly recommended to set up your own SeaTable Server. Refer to the [Admin manual](https://admin.seatable.com) for installation instructions.

## Programming skills

Your development requirements will vary based on your intended project. Below is an outline of the skills you might need:

=== "Scripts"

    Scripts inside SeaTable can only be written with either Javascript or Python. Therefore you will only require one of these programming languages.

=== "Plugins"

    The development of a custom plugin for your own SeaTable Server requires profound knowlegde of Javascript and react.

    Even if the `SeaTable plugin templates` offers some reusable components, you will need some experience with react to build the interface of your plugin.

=== "Client API's"

    Due to the publicly available and well documented API documentation, you can theoretically interact with SeaTable using any programming language.

## Learn the fundamentals

If you're relatively new to development, diving into general tutorials can lay a strong foundation for your SeaTable development journey.

While numerous free online tutorials cover various programming languages, investing in a comprehensive online course or a well-structured book can be invaluable. While free resources are available, a structured course or book often offers a more cohesive and thorough learning experience.

These paid resources, though requiring a small investment, often provide:

- **Structured Learning**: A step-by-step approach ensuring a coherent understanding.
- **Comprehensive Content**: In-depth coverage of essential concepts and practical applications.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring continuity and coherence in learning.

Remember, while free tutorials are abundant, investing in a structured resource can significantly expedite your learning process and provide a solid understanding of programming fundamentals essential for SeaTable development.
