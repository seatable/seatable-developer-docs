# Python client

The SeaTable Python Client encapsulates SeaTable Server Restful API. You can call it in your python program.

!!! info "Unique Python library"
    Unlike JavaScript, external python programs and python scripts, executed in SeaTable, use the same python library and therefore share the same functions. For an overview of the available functions, read the chapter of [script programming with Python](../scripts/python/introduction.md) in this documentation."

## Installation

```
pip3 install seatable-api
```

The source code of the Python Client API is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/seatable/seatable-api-python).
