# Ruby client

One of our community members [made a first version](https://forum.seatable.com/t/seatable-ruby-ruby-gem-for-seatable/2366) of a SeaTable Ruby client.

The source code of the Ruby client API and additional explanations are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/viktorMarkevich/seatable_ruby).
